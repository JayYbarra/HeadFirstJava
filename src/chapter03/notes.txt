- Variables come in two flavors:
  1. primitive- hold fundamental values (think: simple bit patterns) including integers, booleans, and floating point numbers.
  2. reference- hold references to objects.
  
- Every variable must have a type and a name. e.g. int count

- A variable is just a cup. A container. It holds something.
